If you don’t add a credit card, it’s possible that you may be able to use a “sandbox” account – I’m not certain. However, it’s highly likely that you won’t be able to do everything we’re doing today in the course.\nThey’ll then ask you a few questions about how you plan to use GCP, and you can answer those however you want.\nWe’ll wait here for around 5 minutes for everyone to catch up, and I’m available in the chat for questions."
